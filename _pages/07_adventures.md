# The Driftless 250 (Drifty 250)

The **Driftless 250**, or **Drifty 250**, is a ~125 mile bike and ~125 mile kayak adventure through southwestern and central Wisconsin. I first participated with my dad in 2020. We purchased bikes specifically for the experience and were very underprepared for the week-long event.

We named ourselves **The Grrfs**, after a horribly drawn giraffe my brother's friend made in high school.

Despite our unpreparedness, we had a great time canoeing, biking, camping, and walking our bikes up hills.

In the end, we completed our first Drifty!

## Round Two

For our next Drifty, my dad and I were slightly more prepared and were able to enjoy the trip together.

## Round Three-ish

For "our" third Drifty, I was in an internship experience in Boulder, CO and was only able to fly back on the last day of the Drifty. So, my dad met me at the airport on his bike and we rode in to the finish line together.

## Round Four

Our most recent Drifty together was transformed into the Lil Drifty. This reduces the total miles spent on land and in the water while also cutting down the usual 7-days to just a long 3-day weekend. This ended up being much more of a challenge than our other adventures because of the time constraints and the weather. We ended up being the first group to finish and only half of the entire group ended up completing the trip.

# Rock to Rock

Due to the Lil Wimpy (or Lil Drifty) taking over for the year, my dad and I decided to take our own adventure. So, we biked from our house in Rock County Wisconsin to Rock Island Wisconsin over the course of a week. This was over 280 miles of biking through rain, shine, country roads, and city streets. My mom and grandparents met us at some key spots so we could relax and have ferry transportation.
