I am an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Stout double majoring in Computer Science as well as Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (AMCS) with a concentration in Software Development. I graduate in May 2025 and will be starting a job as a Backend Developer at IBM.

As a Co-President of the AMCS Women’s Group, a Student Representative for the AMCS Program Advisory Committee, and a Student Office Assistant in the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department, I have been surrounded by a larger network of individuals in and interested in the mathematics and computer science fields. By being an active member of UW-Stout’s Honors College I have also been provided with greater opportunities for community engagement on and off campus. With a future career in computer science, I hope to grow my connections with a variety of talents and interests while also expanding my technical knowledge and practical skills.
