I created this site for the final project of my Advanced Web and Internet Programming Course (CS-404) for the Spring 2025 semester. I've initially included projects that I've completed in my coursework or internships while studying at the University of Wisconsin - Stout. I've also expanded to include some of my outdoor adventures, academic opportunities, and a few other key features of a basic portfolio.
