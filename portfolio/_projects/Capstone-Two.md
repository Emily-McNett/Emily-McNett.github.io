During the Spring 2025 Semester I pitched a project on creating a Book store and cafe Management System. My team and I decided to call this Novel Brews. We completed this project in an Agile-Scrum method. I was working throughout the semester with my team to complete the system in 5 2-3-week sprints.

Below are my proposal slides for the project.

This is an initial ER Diagram I created for my team to gain a better understanding of what we could do with the idea.

This is our final poster that we presented as apart of our final sprint.
